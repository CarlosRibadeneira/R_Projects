# R_Projects

Project 1 shows a simple exercise to start getting familiar with the R’s syntax and functionalities. In this basic example, I created a function that takes one argument “temperature” and returns a value of hot if temperature is greater or equal to 90, warm if temperature is greater than 60 but less than 90, cold if it is more than 32 but less than 60 and freezing if temperature is 32 or below. Also, a loop was created detailing a message that matched the length of some words. Finally, I added some joins using nycflights13 library dPset2.

Project 2 shows my personal approach when developing a function with inputs of data and season regarding English Premier League Soccer Standings. The final results includes data, home team, away team, goals scored by the home team and many other internal calculations. This project tested my R skills when manipulating real data. 

Project 3 presents a linear regression that solidified all the mechanics associated with regression analysis.

Project 4 was a great experience that I would like to share in my portfolio. It was selected as the best technical report in my Analytics class. This team work was challenging and rewarding. We applied random forest and gradient boosted trees to determine which produced the highest prediction accuracy. It was a binary classification problem. The objective was to minimize the log loss by determining the ROC-AUC score. https://1drv.ms/w/s!AqWIgPdfPBHxm2MnPc1IcLB-UEbn?e=DwdlfZ
